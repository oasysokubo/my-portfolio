Welcome, I'm Oasys!<br><br>
I love to create software and applicable projects to ease the world and make our society a better place. 
I love to work on projects  with my friends and colleagues, and learn more everyday to improve what I can do.<br><br>

As a Computer Science and Engineering graduate student at University of California, Santa Cruz, I am excited and eager to 
learn and experiment in AI, Deep Learning/Machine Learning, and Data Science.<br><br>I boost my expertise in these areas working 
on several independent projects and going through internships and mentorships throughout my years in University. <br><br>
