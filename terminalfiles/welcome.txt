<b>Welcome!</b><br/><br>
My name is Oasys Okubo and I am a Computer Science master student at the University of California, Santa Cruz.<br/>

My portfolio is based on an ubuntu terminal and I wrote it from scratch with javascript.<br/>
If you are familiar with this sort of terminal, you are welcome to use the commands, otherwise you can just click those links.<br/>
For a list of commands, type '<a href="#" class="helpcmd" onclick="clickCmd('help')">help</a>'<br/>
