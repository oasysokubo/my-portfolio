Here are some machine learning & data science related projects that I've done!<br><br>

<a href="datafly.online">Datafly</a> - An AutoML and data analytical software that facilitates the understanding of data through interpretable analysis. 
A project started with a co-founder of Data Science Club, inspired by the potentials of data science and software technology. <br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/oasysokubo/pacAI" target="_blank">pacAI</a> - Won 2nd place out of 21 teams to build an agent that competed against other teams in a capture the flag tournament<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/oasysokubo/NarrowQA" target="_blank">NarrowQA</a> - This project is a Question-Answering application that answers factoid questions based on the given narrative text. This uses Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques, implementing Consituency and Dependency Parsing. Moreover, Regex Chunking is used extensively to parse unnecessary words from a question to make the answer parsing process more efficient.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/oasysokubo/DeepDrive" target="_blank">DeepDrive</a> - DeepDrive simulates a self-driving car that is entirely fuelled by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Tensorflow and Computer Vision using OpenCV. There are many processes that I have gone through to make this project go through succesfully.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/oasysokubo/StockForecaster" target="_blank">Stock Forecasting</a> - An implementation of an Artificial Neural Network using Keras for predicting the stock price movement. Also to download historic prices, apply a strategy, and see the strategy performance vis-a-vis the actual stock prices.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/datascienceucsc/dss-earthquakes" target="_blank">LANL Earthquake Prediction</a> - Forecasting earthquakes is one of the most important problems in Earth science because of their
 devastating consequences. Current scientific studies related to earthquake forecasting focus on three key points: when the event will occur, where it will occur, and how large it will be.
 In this project, we find when the earthquake will take place. Specifically, predicting the time remaining before laboratory earthquakes occur from real-time seismic data.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/datascienceucsc/kaggle-moa-prediction" target="_blank">Kaggle MOA Prediction</a> - Goal of this project is to advancing drug development through improvements to MoA 
prediction algorithms. We developed a multi-label classification algorithm that automatically labels each case in the test set as one or more MoA classes.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/datascienceucsc/workshops" target="_blank">Data Science Slugs Workshops</a> - This (WIP) repository hosts all the deliverables for Data Science Slugs @ UCSC's workshops and activities - or at least those were a member who bothered to use version control was in charge.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/datascienceucsc/dss-disastertweets" target="_blank">Disaster Tweets</a> - Is this tweet real or not?<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/oasysokubo/VoiceAssistant" target="_blank">Speech Interpreter</a> - This project is a Voice Recognition and Synthesizer that allows for users to speak natural english and receive audible feedback on what the user said based on the current words in the grammar file (dictionary). 
I made this project because I wanted to know how to aid individuals with disabilities<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/oasysokubo/FaceNet" target="_blank">FaceNet</a> - Facial recognition and detection desktop software using OpenCV.<br><br>
